    "\n",
    "San Francisco is the nation’s leader in terms of property crime and also one of the most expensive cities in the US to live in. Hence, besides considering housing prices and the convenience of the neighborhood when looking for housing, we also have to consider how safe it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the Fair Housing Act, land lords usually steer away from answering the questions on neighborhood safety and crime rates. Answering these questions is considered as discrimination in Real Estate Sales since mentioning the safety of the neighborhood might sway your decision in renting the apartment."

    "As a recent college graduate in the Bay Area, one of the biggest concerns for many of my friends and me is finding housing in the city of San Francisco. San Francisco has many neighborhoods with its own distinct culture and charm, hence the crime rates, housing prices and nearby venues / amenities can be vastly different even for juxtapose neighborhoods. \n",

    "- Close to the grocery store (walkable distance)\n",

    "\n",
    "Distance to the office is usually an important factor in choosing housing too, but as many of us have a work from home option, it will be disregarded in this project. "
